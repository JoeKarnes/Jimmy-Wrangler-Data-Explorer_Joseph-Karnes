#The main goal of this project was to see if the average cost of insurance from each state in the US had a significant effect on the amount of tests or the amount of fatalities from each respective state.
#The dataset with information on COVID-19 was sourced from Kaggle, which has recent data (last updated date was August 29th) on the number of positive and negative tests, as well as fatalities from each state. On the page, the us_states_covid19_daily.csv file was obtained. (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa?select=us_states_covid19_daily.csv)
For the average insurance costs, statistics were obtained from a study posted on commonwealth.org, which had data sourced from the federal Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC). The sourced data from Commonwealth had merely collected  the values from all of the spreadsheets from each state on the MEPS-IC site.

There were some aspects of the data that I had manually altered due to time constraints. These aspects were the titles of each of the two columns and the replacement of each state name with its abbreviation for better compatibility with the COVID-19 dataset.
